After the company’s owners parted ways in December 1937 the factory was moved to Lock Haven, PA and reorganized as the Piper Aircraft Company. When first produced, the J-3 was powered by the same Continental A-40 engine used on the E-2 and J-2 but the requirement for dual ignition engines was enacted around that time and the Cub was fitted with other engines, finally settling on the Continental 65 HP engine, an important part of the Cub legend. Today's popularity of the Cub is not simply nostalgia, it is "stick and rudder flying" in its most elementary form.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 65 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 76 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 680 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 1220 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 35'3"</p><p>Length: 22'5"</p><p>Height: 6'8"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 11,500'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 450' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 19,888</p><p>(Data pulled from Joseph Juptner's <em>U.S. Civil Aircraft</em> series.)</p>

" width="250"><p>Donation: Terry Brandt</p><p>Engine: Continental A-65, 65 HP</p><p>Cubs could be fitted with floats for water operations, particularly for back country use. While the floats are large, they are very light. Floats generally cause considerable drag and slow the airspeed of an airplane but the Cub on floats actually flies 2 MPH faster than a Cub on wheels due to the geometry of the installation. The Cub floats generate their own lift, taking some load off the wings.</p>

" width="250" height="187"><p>Acquired with funds from museum donations.</p><p>Piper was the last of the three civilian “cub type” companies contracted to build their version of a training glider. Piper’s design was a favorite because so much of the glider was kept similar to their L-birds. By utilizing cost-cutting elements such as using rudder pedal springs for the spoiler return springs and other techniques, the cost of the TG-8 came in well under the other TGs at $2108 per glider. WAAAM’s TG-8 left service in late 1944 and was acquired by WAAAM as a project in 2012 through the generosity of the museum’s donors. The&nbsp; restoration began under Director of Aircraft Restorations Tom Murphy and finished by his successor Jakonah “Jay” Matson Bell and our crew of volunteers. WAAAM took it to EAA's Airventure in Oshkosh, WI in 2018 where it flew in the Warbird Review during the Friday and Saturday airshows.</p>

" width="250" height="187"><p>Donation: GM "Sam" Grotte</p><p>Engine: Lycoming O-320, 150 HP</p><p>In essence, a widened PA-12 Super Cruiser with the addition of flaps, Piper's PA-14 Family Cruiser was the company’s response to the demand for four-seat airplanes. The accommodations were, to be charitable, “cozy.” Unfortunately, the airplane was introduced shortly before Piper’s financial straits drove it into receivership and only 238 were built. Today many of the those still flying are Alaska where they have been much-modified and are considered desirable workhorses of backcountry flying. Reflecting its backcountry role, the WAAAM PA-14 is on floats. This aircraft was refurbished in our restoration shop during Winter 2018 and went on display in March 2019.</p>

" width="250" height="187"><p>Donation: North Cascades Vintage Aircraft Museum</p><p>Engine: Lycoming O-145, 65 HP</p><p>The Vagabond was Piper’s first post-war design. Its structure was similar to the Cub and it was built on much of the same production tooling. The fuselage changed from the tandem seating of the Cub to side-by-side seating. The cost savings realized by using existing material and design probably saved Piper from bankruptcy at that time. The PA-17 model was nearly the same but added dual controls for training and bungee cord suspension vs. the single controls and solid gear of the PA-15.</p>

The Clipper’s cost was 40% below the average for a four-seat airplane. Pan American Airways disputed the name, though, as “Clipper” denoted its luxury airliners. After one year’s production, upgrades to the Clipper begat the Pacer.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 117 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 125 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 850 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 1650 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 29'2"</p><p>Length: 20'1"</p><p>Height: 6'2"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 13,500'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 600' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 736</p>
