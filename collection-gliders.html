                        <p>Wilbur and Orville Wright were determined and meticulous experimenters and after their wind tunnel experiments of 1901 showed that the Lilienthal data on wing design was wrong they applied what they had learned to the following season’s glider experiments. On this, their third glider design, they changed the shape of the wing cross section and built the first aircraft to use three-axis (pitch, yaw and roll) control. They flew in a prone position, controlled wing warp by sliding side to side in a hip cradle and controlled the elevator by rolling a horizontal bar with their hands. The rudders were coupled to the wing warping mechanism for coordinated flight, the first time that the rudders were not fixed in one position. They made nearly 1,000 flights in September and October 1902 and as many again in September and October 1903. The Wrights abandoned their glider at Kitty Hawk in 1903 and the only remaining part of it is a single wingtip in the Smithsonian Institution collection.</p>
                        <p>*Parts for this replica were built by Jud L. Ketola over a number of years and it was completed for display by WAAAM volunteers in 2018.</p>

Alfaro designed and flew airplanes throughout his life, many of them while he lived in the U.S. His best known airplane is a modification, for the 1927 Dole Trophy Race, of the Air King biplane “City of Peoria”. Alfaro was an instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for a time and around 1938 developed an axial engine that was produced by the Hendee Manufacturing Company, maker of Indian motorcycles. Little information is available on the Alfaro PTG-2 Primary Glider except that at least five are known to have been registered in the U.S. around 1930. It is likely that the WAAAM PTG-2 is the only one remaining.</p>

The glider uses a wheeled dolly for takeoff which the pilot jettisons when it leaves the ground. The landing gear is a main skid and a tail skid, typical for the time. It was considered an intermediate performance glider and flights of 200-300 km were flown in it.</p><p>This project on display will be restored when given enough time and funding.</p>

		            <img src="#" alt="WAAAM's 1930 WACO Primary Glider flying during our May 2016 Second Saturday event. "><p>Donation: Terry Brandt</p><p>Charles Lindbergh’s Trans-Atlantic flight of 1927 fanned interest in aviation across the U.S.A. The cheapest way to participate was with a primary glider which saw great popularity in the late 1920’s in Europe. After WWI Germany was not permitted to build and fly powered aircraft so they took a particular interest in gliders. Primary gliders are minimal aircraft, little more than a seat on a wood or steel tube truss with a wing and tail feathers attached. They were most often launched from a hilltop by several men pulling on shock cords (bungees). WACO and Cessna were among the U.S. builders of these birds. Primary gliders were successful as trainers in Europe but were less successful in the U.S. where Europe’s discipline in primary glider training was absent. The U.S. accident rate far exceeded that of Europe and the Air Bureau stepped in to stanch the bloodshed. The WAAAM WACO Primary Glider, a WACO-built original, was restored by museum volunteers in 2014.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Glide Ration: 15:1</p><p>Empty Weight: 225 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 450 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 36'</p><p>Length: 21'</p><p>Height: 10'</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 300-ish</p>

"><p>Acquired with funds from Don Mayo.</p><p>The Franklin PS-2 glider first flew in 1931. It was designed by R.E. Franklin, a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at University of Michigan who built it as an improvement over the German designs then in use. The wing is braced with struts rather than with multiple wires as was then common practice. Assembly and disassembly is much easier with struts than with wires. In 1933 Stan Smith won the National Soaring Championship in a Franklin PS-2. In 1934 three PS-2s were used in a trial of the Lustig Skytrain, a multi-glider towing arrangement intended for delivery of goods and mail. Departing New York, the three gliders were towed in a line then released in sequence over their respective destinations of Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Also in 1934, the U.S. Navy procured six PS-2s for training though these saw little use. WAAAM's PS-2 is sporting the Navy PS-2 colors. In 1938 one of the Navy PS-2s was transferred to NACA (forerunner of NASA) where it was used for ground effect research by towing a PS-2 behind a specially designed automobile. The WAAAM PS-2 was owned and flown by the University of Michigan Glider Club until 1943.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Glide Ration: 15:1</p><p>Empty Weight: 220 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 400 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 36'</p><p>Length: 17'6"</p><p>Height: 6'10"</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 54</p>

" width="250" height="187"><p>Photo credit: Lyle Jansma</p><p>Acquired with funds from Jerry Wenger</p><p>Fred Slingsby was an RAF pilot who repaired gliders and designed his own which were based on German designs. He founded Slingsby Sailplanes, Ltd., moved it to the village of Kirbymoorside, England and in 1935 made improvements to the very successful German Grunau Baby II, which he was building under license. He extended the wing span slightly, used Grunau Baby parts wherever he could and streamlined the fuselage, dubbing his glider the T.6 Kirby Kite. It was a high performance aircraft for its time, making a 55-mile flight in its first competition. In WWII sixteen Kirby Kites were impressed into service for RAF pilot training. Of the many Kirby Kites built only about eight remain. The one in WAAAM’s collection was restored by Bob Gaines with the original varnish finish it had from the factory in 1939. In 2002 this airplane won the Vintage Sailplane Association Restoration Award.</p>

After just three units production halted due to World War II. During the war this Petrel was impressed for training both anti-aircraft gun crews and the Royal Observer Corps’ aerial spotters. Post-war, as British Glider Association (BGA) 418, WAAAM’s Petrel continued to draw the eyes of many including the glider enthusiast Bob Gaines of the USA who purchased this glider in 2001 and was flying it stateside by 2002. Gaines began a complete restoration in 2005 but he passed away before it was finished. Through the generosity of WAAAM’s donors, the museum was able to acquire four gliders from the Gaines collection. The Petrel restoration was completed to original factory style and once again took to the air in June 2017.</p>

It was sold as a series of partial kits offering affordable flying at a time when money was hard to come by. The kit cost totaled $425 but, for those who could afford it, the Baby Albatross was available factory-built and ready to fly for about $750. The fuselage pod is a wooden monocoque design and the balance of the structure is wood with fabric covering. The wing design was based on that of the German Grunau Baby 2. Parts for 90 aircraft were made but according to the National Air and Space Museum probably only 50-60 were completed and flown. Distance flights of 263 and 280 miles were flown in the Baby Albatross as well as a flight to 10,000 feet of altitude. Bowlus’ company was backed by many aviation luminaries such as Reuben H. Fleet, Al Menasco, Donald Douglas and Glenn Martin.</p>

Piper’s design was a favorite because so much of the glider was kept similar to their L-birds. By utilizing cost-cutting elements such as using rudder pedal springs for the spoiler return springs and other techniques, the cost of the TG-8 came in well under the other TGs at $2108 per glider. WAAAM’s TG-8 left service in late 1944 and was acquired by WAAAM as a project in 2012 through the generosity of the museum’s donors. The&nbsp; restoration began under Director of Aircraft Restorations Tom Murphy and finished by his successor Jakonah “Jay” Matson Bell and our crew of volunteers.

Construction is tube and fabric fuselage with a fabric covered wood wing. All but one of the production run of 114 were built for the U.S. Army Air Force. Nearly two years after the war ended the FAA issued a type certificate for it as the Schweizer SGS 2-12 although none were built as that model. This is the last known flying aircraft of its kind.</p>

The glider has a retractable wheel and flaps that change the wing’s camber (shape), features that moved it from the 15-meter class to the Open class for competition. Other features that made it a standout include a tongue-fork wing attachment (soon adopted by other manufacturers), spring-seated airbrakes and a compartment built into the leading edge for water ballast that is used to increase wing-loading for higher speeds on cross country flights. Two different canopies were available, one with a vent for normal flight and one for racing.</p>
