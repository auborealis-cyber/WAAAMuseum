    <h3>Museum Collection</h2>
    <p>Visitors at WAAAM quickly realize that our vehicles are not just a collection of old, unusable stuff. Once restored by our amazingly gifted volunteers, all of our antique cars and planes can and do run. More than that, they purrrrrr!</p>
    <h2>Automobile Collection</h2>
  <img src="img/driving-thru-decades-class.jpg" alt="vintage car lineup" class="img-fluid">
    <p>Our antique automobiles range in age from 1900's to the 1960's. But mostly, they're from the "Golden Age of Transportation," which took place around the 1920's, 30's, and 40's.  Here are some examples ...</p>
    <p>WAAAM's Locomobile is our 1923 Model 48 Sportif which was donated to WAAAM by Wes and Nancy Lematta of Columbia Helicopters. At a time when Ford was building thousands of cars every week Locomobile was building just four a week and each was a work of art.</p>
    <p>Among our unusual cars are the Franklins from 1909 and 1929. The Franklin engines are air cooled and extremely well designed. The 1929 was even driven from Portland to WAAAM under its own power!</p>
    <p>...and that's just scratching the surface!</p>

		      <p><img src="./img/automobile-list-photos/1900_Locomobile_Steam_Car_Runabout.jpg" alt="WAAAM's 1900 Locomobile Steam Car just as it arrived at the museum.">Year: 1900</p>
          <p>Donor: Acquired with funds from Bill Bremmeyer</p>
          <p>Engine: 2 Cyl., 5.5 HP</p>
          <p>Transmission: None</p>
          <p>Number of Doors: Open-doored</p>
          <p>Curb Weight in Lbs: approx 650</p>
          <p>One of the many things modern users of automobiles take for granted is that more often than not, our cars work without much effort on the part of the user. When automobiles first got on the scene the belief that a horseless carriage could function well was not held by many. All makers of automobiles contrived of various "tests" to build public confidence in their devices. The informational booklet that came with this Locomobile describes two of these tests.</p>
          <p>"One of our 'Locomobiles' was run by an expert for 72 miles with 2.75 gallons of gasoline, at a cost of 17.5 cents. One tank of water sufficed for a run of 48 miles. The carriage was operated by an expert.</p>
          <p>At a test made at Charles River Park, Boston, the 'Locomobile' climbed a 36% incline. Starting from Newton, traveling over all kinds of roads and carrying two persons, the 'Locomobile' climbed to the summit of Mt. Washington. Distance traveled to foot of mountain 205 miles. Average speed maintained 14.1 miles per hour. Accidents, none; neither on the trip, nor during the ascent nor descent. Gasoline consumed during the ascent, 1.75 gallons. Water consumed during ascent, 21 gallons."</p>

          <p>Technically an Everybody's Motor Car Mfg. Co. Runabout - this automobile had a very small production run and was built around 1907. It has a very neat air-cooled flat twin engine. This car has some great local history. It was the third car ever registered in The Dalles. The family who bought it used it as a company car for the Seufert Cannery. It was purchased from a catalog and delivered by rail from St. Louis. When the original owner went to pick it up and drive it home, he found it was shipped disassembled. He had to hire a mechanic to put it together! It took us just over a year for our volunteer crew to restore this automobile. <a href="https://youtu.be/VCi8l0B-zlo" target="_blank" rel="alternate noopener noreferrer">Click here to check out the state the wheels were in.</a></p>

          <p>WAAAM’s Franklin Model D is a good representation of early vehicle technology. It has no electric starter, no generator,and no battery. For lighting it relies kerosene burning lamps on the two sides and single rear light as well as two carbide fueled lights for the headlights. Franklin Model Ds had a four-cylinder, air-cooled inline engine. It also has a right hand drive.</p>

          <p>We like to call this tractor a Hood River icon. For many decades it was a main feature in the Hood River 4<sup>th</sup>of July Parades. In the mid-80s it fell in to disrepair and people no longer got to see it. When the museum opened it fit right in with our antiques. It took us a while to find a team to restore it but once they started the tractor was back up and running in under 6 months! Originally we had thought this was a 1911 but as we restored the tractor all the serial and part numbers we found were from 1910 – our guess is that it was built in 1910 and by the time it reached the Hood River Valley, it was 1911 but still a “brand new” tractor. That’s more than 100 years of confusion cleared up!</p>

          <p>This car was the main mode of transportation for the early Hood River dentist Dr. S.C. Gaulke. It changed hands amongst the Gaulke family before it came to WAAAM but none of the family was quite sure on the year of the car. WAAAM's resident experts took a look and found yet another classic example of a common early automotive practice - to use up the old stock of parts before transitioning to the all new year of parts.</p>

          <p>The REO Motor Car Company was founded by Ransome E. Olds in 1905. While company literature varies between “REO” and “Reo” for their capitalization, all agree that you pronounce the REO like the Rio Grande River or Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. This company made some of the more affordable luxury-style cars on the market at the time before branching out into other things like trucks due to competition from Ford and General Motors. While WAAAM is still working to substantiate this claim, all previous owners have handed down the story that WAAAM’s REO was driven in promotional tours for the Apollo space program.</p>

          <p>Electric cars are over 100 years old! In 1891 the first successful electric automobile in the United States was built and soon after Anderson Electric Car Company (the makers of this Detroit Electric) started their electric car production in 1907. WAAAM’s Detroit Electric still has its original rechargeable lead acid batteries from the Edison Electric Company. Detroit Electrics were advertised to get 80 miles to the charge at speeds of 20-25 mph which was just right for the two most common types of electric car vehicle owners – doctors making house calls or ladies visiting friends and relatives. The WAAAM car is currently being restored back to operating condition on our display floors. *There is currently some debate on the age of the year of this vehicle. Stop on by to hear about our latest findings.</p>

          <p>The Ford Model T Depot Hack was created to carry passengers and their luggage to and from the railway depots. By 1914, the assembly process for the Model T had been so streamlined it took only 93 minutes to assemble a car. That year Ford produced more cars than all other automakers combined.</p>

          <p>1915 marked two big turning points for the Ford Model T – it was the end of the brass era for the cars, production shifted to all black cars, and the one millionth Ford Model T was produced. During the original restoration of this runabout, many layers of built up dirt and grime were stripped from the body revealing the original black paint and two different advertisements for early Pillsbury products. At the time automobiles were still novel enough that advertisements like this would easily stand out for anyone who saw the car which made the artwork a good investment for many companies looking to capitalize on new ideas of brand recognition, customer loyalty, and outdoor advertising.</p>

          <p>When the John and Horace Dodge left the Ford Motor Company in 1913 they did not leave empty handed. After years of working with Ford and the development of his automobiles, in particular the wildly popular Model T, they knew all of the car’s faults and weaknesses and had plenty of ideas on how to fix them. Because the Dodge brothers still had a large amount of stock with the Ford Motor Company they were able to bankroll their own car company. The Dodge Brothers automobiles flourished as the brothers were able to utilize their full mechanical ability and design sense. The Dodge brothers continued to fund their Dodge Brothers automobiles on Ford stocks until Ford bought them and other investors out in 1919. WAAAM’s 1916 Roadster is a popular driver on Second Saturdays and during special event parades.</p>

          <p>Federal Trucks were known for their no-nonsense, straightforward designs and were often called a trucker's truck. Unlike many early automobile manufacturers that contracted parts and pieces out to other companies, Federal did most of their machining and bodywork in house which resulted in a superior quality product. Federal trucks were one of the many types of trucks used during World War I. There is some anecdotal evidence that Federal trucks were often used to transport the new (very finicky) tanks to the front for deployment. WAAAM's favorite of the original advertisements proudly proclaims that Federal trucks helped keep flyers in the sky by being large and strong enough to haul airplane parts to pilots in need. </p>

          <p>This King Car was originally purchased by the Kingsoving family. In the Fall of 1955, Frank Alberti came across it in the middle of their farm and after a day of negotiating and promising to “restore it right,” he bought the car. The maker of the car, Charles B. King, was the first man to design, build, and drive a car on the streets of Detroit. King rubbed elbows with many other notable names in automobile history including the Henry Ford, Ransom Olds, Frank Duryea, and many others. Early King Company advertisements proclaimed that King cars were the first cars in America with cantilever springs, <em>en bloc</em> motor, center control, and left side drive – these features became automobile industry standards over time. Alberti drove it in many parades in his local community. On August 15, 2015, Alberti threw his King Car a farewell parade before donating it to WAAAM.</p>

          <p>For the longest time museum founder, Terry Brandt, wanted a World War I vehicle to go with WAAAM’s crown jewel, a 1917 Curtiss Jenny. For years he, along with other volunteers, collected the parts that would become this vehicle. WAAAM Volunteer Gene Wright built the chassis and made plans for the body. WAAAM Volunteer Andy Anderson put the collection of pieces together. No plans could be found so the restoration crew worked from pictures to ensure that they made an accurate vehicle. This process was very similar to what would have been done during World War I. Ford would supply contractors with the chassis and the rest of the vehicle would be done with the specific shop’s own vision of perfection. The project was finished and unveiled in May 2013 during our Second Saturday event. The restoration was funded entirely from our visitors’ generosity and the donations of parts from many individuals.</p>

In this demonstration WAAAM Volunteers start with the car completely disassembled and work against the clock to reassemble it as quickly as possible. Crowds watch in wonder as all of the parts and pieces fit back into place and the engine is lowered in and reattached. The contest ends when this Model T starts up and drives again!

          <p>This Model T helps tell the story of every day people adjusting cars to work for them. Ford did not build a "factory pickup" until 1925 but that didn't stop folks from converting roadsters and touring cars into trucks and other haulers to get the job done. "Fifi" the Pickup Truck is currently masquerading as an early aviation gas truck with a large tank in the truck bed. Sometimes you can spot her as a water wagon or mail carrier depending on the display she is found in.</p>

          <p>WAAAM's Velie is a Model 58 5-Passenger Touring Car. The Velie (pronounced Vee-Lee) Carriage Company started out making buggies in 1902. In 1908 they transitioned to automobiles and by 1927 they had diversified again and were manufacturing airplanes. (WAAAM also has a 1928 Velie Monocoupe 70 airplane on display.) According to the Official Velie Registry, there are only approximately 220 of this company’s cars still around today. Back in the early 2000s WAAAM’s Velie was almost done being restored by a former owner. Unfortunately, there was a big storm and a tree fell on the barn it was housed in. Oddly enough some of the volunteers we have restoring this car also worked on it during its previous, ultimately-doomed, restoration attempt. As of August 2014 we can run the car but with no seats, floor boards, or brakes. Week by week this car gets closer and closer to becoming a finished restoration project.</p>

          <p>This is one of the Model Ts that is use for the Model T Driving School. Every spring through fall WAAAM has a few classes to take people back through time and to teach people how to drive this iconic vehicle. When WAAAM taught the very first Model T Driving School class the seats were little more than exposed springs covered with burlap and carpeting to make it a bit more comfortable. Since then the upholstery has been replaced with more comfortable cushions. Thanks to the funds provided from the Model T Driving School WAAAM is able to keep this and other vehicles in working order so that generations to come can not only see these iconic machines in action but actually have the opportunity to drive a piece of living history.</p>

          <p>First cars always carry fond memories for most folks. WAAAM Museum Founder Terry Brandt's first car was a Ford Model T quite similar to this one. Brandt got it from a friend of his dad's when he was a young teenager because it could hardly drive and didn't have a steering wheel. The car provided hours of entertainment. Although Brandt's original vehicle was left behind to the pages of history, when the museum got wind of this particular all-original 1923 Model T with reverse opening doors, Brandt jumped at the chance to acquire it for the good of the collection. Oddly enough, one of our volunteers who passed away a number of years ago used to own this car. He's the reason it was kept in such great condition for all these years. After a quick tune up it was back on the road once again.</p>

          <p>In 1897 the Autocar Company produced its first vehicle and by 1899 it was building the first motor truck commercially available in the U.S. These early delivery vehicles had an "engine-under-the-seat" design that maximized the area for freight and were the precursor to the modern designs still used today by many truck companies. By 1911, Autocar specialized in trucks with lots of custom work and purpose built vehicles for different specialized trades. "Big and Tough" became the Autocar creed as their trucks became the must-have tool for the roughest industries, including mining, oil drilling, and logging. This specialization lead to industry dominance as early as the 1920s. Some other notable firsts we can thank the Autocar Company for include America's first shaft driven vehicle, the first double reduction rear axle, and the first viable circulating oil system.</p>

          <p>Almost as soon as automobiles began increasing in popularity with mass-market consumers aftermarket add-ons became the new normal. People wanted more lights, more seats, bigger trunk racks and more. The most popular of these aftermarket adjustments was turning car chassis into truck chassis to haul goods around. While today we are used to trucks coming purpose-built and ready to go, nearly all early trucks were the product of self-styling needs or custom jobs until Ford's factory-built-as-an-actual-truck truck was born in 1925.</p>

          <p>This 3/4 ton special delivery truck has been on display at WAAAM since 2011. When it was donated the museum did some digging and discovered that the body was built by the Willard company in Portland, Oregon. After more digging we found out about the real-life bread company the side panel artwork was from too. The Stein Bakery opened in Portland, Oregon back September 17, 1888, with 17 year old German immigrant Carl C. Stein and a business partner at the helm. By the end of the year Stein took full control of the business and there was no looking back. (The bakery was originally called the Vienna Bakery and was changed to Stein's Bakery in 1922). Dubbed "the pioneer baker of Portland" by the Oregonian, Stein was successful enough that he progressively expanded his operation over the decades. According to "History of the Columbia River Valley From The Dalles to the Sea, Vol. III" by 1927 Stein's Bakery had 7 delivery wagons. Stein himself retired from the business in 1941. The original Stein's Bakery building was demolished to make way for the Stadium Freeway and Stein's Bakery merged with an Oroweat branch in Beaverton by 1965. As the print on WAAAM's International Truck suggests - Stein's pumpkernickle and rye breads were the most popular of their baked goods.</p>

          <p>When WAAAM first started the Model T Driving School back in 2011 no one ever anticipated the class taking off as well as it did. After the 2013 classes, the museum knew another car was needed. The volunteers went out and hunted for a good Model T driver for students to learn on. When everything was said and done this 1927 Coupe came away as the winner. Using some of the funds generated to keep the class going and the cars operational for the class – a bit of a tall order considering the wear student drivers can put on them – the museum purchased this Model T. Since we've had the car we've swapped out the leopard print seat coverings and a few other things to bring it back to a more original condition as students continue to use it to experience living history at its finest.</p>

          <p>Even in the earliest days of the automobile, people tried their hand at racing - first against horses, then against the time clock, and eventually against other automobiles. By the 1920s, car racing culture was well established as racers worked to find ways to beef their engines up or strip "unnecessary" parts off their car in an effort to go faster than ever before. This 1927 Model T Speedster is an homage to those early drivers.</p>

          <p>The Moon company began making cars in 1905. Their peak years were in the later 1920s with the company going bust as so many did in the 1930s. In 1927 Moon produced 4,180 automobiles with around 360-400 of those being in the Brougham style. While the early history of this particular car is lost to the ages, it was re-imported to the USA from Canada as a project back in 2002. According to the Moon Car Club this is the only 1927 Moon Brougham currently known in existence. </p>

          <p>The original owner of this car was from Spokane, Washington. He bought it new as a coupe but wrecked it nearly beyond repair just before he fought in World War II. He sold the pieces to a nearby farmer who was crafty enough to graft a Model T pickup bed on the back to breath new life into the car after several hefty repairs and alterations including adding a convertible top. By the 1970s farm life for this car was over. It was purchased by another Spokane-ite who wanted to turn it into a hot rod. He got as far as putting in red plastic seat covers and a matching steering wheel before a new addition to his family and he sold his project in 1980. By this time the car was more rusty than the original red color and didn't function well. It underwent a full restoration to become a yellow depot hack with period correct seat covers and other cosmetic changes. The car did a lot of touring during this era going as far afield as Clagary, Canada and Reno, Nevada. It changed hands again in 2014. This time, with a nod to the car's diverse lifestyle, it was outfitted with all manner of antique accoutrements and transformed into a "Grapes of Wrath" car. The vehicle itself still runs well but the paint was purposefully marred to regain a more vintage patina.</p>

          <p>Sometimes you find an old car that still has a bit of life but is really rough shape. Historically, these cars were often turned into stripped down "speedsters" or were "rodded out" with a bit custom fun. This vehicle was painstakingly restored with a hard-to-manufacture boat-tail-style rear end. As of 2020, it meets the current road rally racing standards for the type of vehicle.</p>

          <p>It may seem odd to us today to name a car "Dictator" but when this line of autos was first unveiled in the late 20s the name was intended to reflect that Studebaker felt that even their low end model could "dictate the standard" for all other car makers as an affordable, reliable, and visually appealing car. The Dictator name cause problems with sales overseas but did fairly well as a line in the US until the growing controversial political climate of the 1930s in Europe began to draw too much scorn on the name and forced Studebaker's hand in an abrupt update.</p>
          <p>WAAAM's Studebaker Dictator is a project but it is currently on the display floor being restored for all to see and enjoy.</p>

          <p>This 3-Window Town Sedan originally came from Montana by way of a Washington collector who was looking for a new project car. It needed substantial restoration work and was donated to the museum with everything finished up except for the paint. This was the first car to inaugurate WAAAM's newly built car shop paint booth. For those with a particular eye for detail - the body is a Murray body (not a Briggs) which was most characterized by the more softer, arched window styling compared to the more standard square windows.</p>

          <p>Sometimes you need to test a car out before you decide to take the plunge and get one for yourself. John Burgess spent many years with his friends in the Gorge Model A Ford Club driving other folks' cars to find just the right style and year he wanted. This 1929 fit the bill. He spent a lot of time tinkering with it and would often drive it around The Dalles on nice days. When he passed, his kids wanted to keep it in the Columbia River Gorge area so they chose to donate it to WAAAM.</p>

          <p>In the automotive world some cars are found pristine in barns, other cars are found rusty and broken down in thickets of plants, other cars you can only find pieces of - bit by bit at a time. This 1929 Franklin is the latter case. It took many years of tracking down pieces at swap meets and other sales to find what was missing off of a very cannibalized frame way back in the 1950s or so. After decades of determination it payed off with one very beautiful air-cooled automobile. (The radiator shell is fake.) This Franklin has been on many shows and tours all around the Pacific Northwest since the 1980s.</p>

The family that donated this car enjoyed taking it out on road trips and tours. They would often stash valuables in the only part of the car you could lock - in the rumble seat compartment.</p>

          <p>The DeSoto Deluxe was an automobile built between 1930 through the 1952 model year. Despite the name, the Deluxe was DeSoto's entry-level car and was offered primarily as two-door and four-door sedans. Early advertising claimed that the body was "rust proofed."</p>

          <p>Hucksters were kit conversions that you could put on the back of many different early truck models. The side flap panels roll up making it easy for vendors to display their goods without having to load and unload their stuff or pay extra to move it around. Think of it as the 1920s or 30s version of a food cart or ice cream truck.</p>

          <p>Will Carey was a Chevy guy. He owned Chevys. Restored Chevys. Lived and breathed Chevys of all eras. When one of his long time friends would joke that Carey should have his very nice vintage Ford when he passed away, Carey never found it funny. When the friend passed it turned out he did indeed will the Ford to a quintessential Chevy man. It has been on display at the museum nearly the moment Carey got it.</p>

            <p>This Plymouth was bought new by farming family in Battle Ground, WA as a weekend driver to get tow town for shopping and church. They passed it along to a collector who loved not only the car but the pristine condition it was in. When the collector passed his stepson wanted to turn the car into a street rod but never found the time to get around to it. Because it was going to be heavily worked on for the conversion, the car sat outside for over a decade. In 1970 Ray Splinter spent an hour cutting it out of the blackberry bushes that had consumed the car. The bones of the body held up fairly well but you could easily poke your finger through any of the interior upholstery. It took 8 years of on-again-off-again work to get the Plymouth restored. Splinter did most of the mechanical work while long time friend and car restorer Jack Woolf did the body work and pain. This car came to WAAAM on loan in 2009 and was donated in 2017.</p>

          <p>Hobbies help add variety to life. Some hobbies take up little space while other hobbies (like car restoration) take up a lot of space. To appease his wife Joyce, master restoration expert Jack Woolf asked her what car <em>she</em> would like him to work on as a gift to her. She picked her all time favorite car - a 1932 Studebaker Model 55 Regis Sport Coupe similar to the ones she saw about town as she was growing up. It took some searching but Woolf found most of one, kept hunting for parts, and eventually was able to restore it as a present for her. Jack and Joyce were married for 78 years before she passed and she used the car as her errand runner about town.</p>

When the farm sold in 1960 he did his best to convince the owner to give him the truck. She said 'no' but offered up a Chrysler that had been sitting in the barn for years. He fell in love with "the machine" as the family called it and spent all summer getting it cleaned up. After only minor tinkering with the help of his father, Bates got the car fired up and would drive it around the property with all the windows open because over the years the safety glass had fogged up. In honor of getting his driver's permit, Bates and his family overhauled the engine to get it road worthy. He drove it to high school and to various jobs around town. Everyone loved "the machine." Over the years he continued working on the car and from the experience gained on it, Bates was promoted from Beaverton School District bus driver to a mechanic and eventually shop foreman.</p>

          <p>This car was purchased by a physician in Bend, Oregon in 1964. He restored, maintained and tinkered with it for many years. One of of his more clever restoration work can be found in a piece of chrome trim that forms a small arc over the transmission cover hump. It was missing from the car and in a time before the internet there wasn't a replacement piece readily available. If you look closely, you can see that the existing piece is made of stainless steel rather than chrome like the rest of the trim. During an operation to remove a rod used to stabilize a broken leg, the physician realized that the cross-sectional shape of part of the rod was very similar to the missing trim piece on the car he was restoring. In the spirit of recycling, re-purposing, and reusing discarded materials, this new found material was incorporated into the car's missing trim.</p>

        <p>The Ford 9N tractor brought about a revolution for Ford tractors. Previous models were well liked but many had a tendency to accidentally flip backward if the implements being pulled on the back encountered an immovable obstruction. Ford partnered with Henry Ferguson outfitting his tractors with a special 3-point hydraulic hitch system which made the tractors not only much safer but changing implements a total breeze. It was light but rugged and cost significantly less than other tractors on the market making it a perfect vehicle for the many small farms that still dotted America.</p>

        <p>For many years in the hard working tractor world, looking good while getting the job done was sidelined for functionality. John Deere bucked the trend with a complete restyling of both their "A" and "B" lines in 1939. Not only was this tractor a powerful workhorse but the streamlined styling and other body tweaks gave the vehicle a more modern feel.</p>

          <p>In 1940 Ford enticed new buyers with 22 new improvements to the year's automobiles. For the Deluxe Sedan this meant general front end restyling with long hoods and long lines.

          <p>With only a month of manufacture for the 1942 Americar, WAAAM's vehicle is quite rare as World War II put a stop to nearly all civilian production of vehicles. The 1942 Americars that did make it to market claimed to be "brothers under the hood" to the much more eponymous (Willys) Jeep touting that they had the same engine that was good enough for the U.S. Army. WAAAM's Americar is also a "survivor car" as well...it was in original, unrestored condition when it was donated to the museum. With just a little tune up, WAAAM volunteers have been able to get it back on the road once again. </p>

This Dodge was most famously used to promote the 100 year anniversary of the Tillamook County Creamery Association during the Rose Festival. Those banners are still up on the truck today. It drove to WAAAM in 2009 and was the first of Splinter's cars to be on display, first on loan and then as part of the permanent collection from 2017 onward.</p>

            <p>As trouble brewed in the boardrooms and stock holdings of the Kaiser-Frazer company, the still fairly novel idea behind a hardtop convertible like the Virginian drew some sway for new car buyers despite only minor changes between the 1949 and 1950 model year. This color, "Indian Ceramic," is a stock color choice that is much more salmon colored than most realize.</p>

            <p>This hard top coupe is still in its original configuration. Even without the very common modifications to turn it into more of a hot rod Oldsmobile 88s still commanded quite a presence both in the NASCAR of yesteryear and other road races like the Pikes Peak climb. With WAAAM's Oldsmobile 88 note the all new period correct interior that was painstakingly restored to factory condition with speciality woven seat and door material locally produced in Oregon. This particular Oldsmobile was purchased as a 50th wedding anniversary gift to commemorate the original vehicle the donors honeymooned in.</p>

            <p>In 1953 Chevy redesigned their multi-functional transport truck launching this line of vehicles into a new era. Cabins now sported adjustable bench seats, doors featured concealed hinges, and windows were considerably larger and had extra auxiliary ventilation ports. Chevy Tank Trucks were a great early form of portable advertising with plenty of body space for promotional slogans or images. WAAAM’s body didn’t have any discernible ads so we gave a nod to the past with our logo instead. <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="alternate">Read all about getting our sign on the car here.</a></p>

          <p>After World War II, consumers in the US were ready for new automobiles. The Kaiser-Frazer company was founded to capitalize on this desire. For a while the company did well but began to be muscled out of the market by larger companies after a number of poor business moves and a general failure to provide consumers with substantial new updates to their models each year. Kaiser Manhattans stressed safety but in this era safety didn't sell well despite a number of promotional extremes like driving down a flight of stone stairs to show off the car's power steering capabilities. Other more common optional features included a tube radio and even air conditioning.</p>

          <p>Mark and Dorothy Sullivan bought this car on March 26, 1955. The original sales slip for $3,040.96 was hand written on a grocery store stationary form from Arcade Pontiac in Washington, D.C. Soon after the car was purchased the family moved to McChord Air Force Base, Washington – they drove all the way there in the Pontiac. After three years at McChord, Mark was posted to Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska. The Pontiac was shipped by rail there and then shipped back after three years and driven to Luke Air Force Base, Arizona, where Mark retired.</p>
          <p>Eventually Mark and Dorothy moved on to newer cars and the Pontiac was passed down to the kids. After changing hands from two of his siblings, ownership of the car fell to Mike. It was well worn out when he got it and he decided to fix it up during his spare time. Mike’s restoration emphasis was to return the car to its original showroom condition. Over the years he kept working at it until the vehicle was completely restored. All the mechanical devices were overhauled to the original specifications and the interior is as close to the original match as he could find. Its most recent paint job took 2 months to complete. To insure the colors were correct Mike contacted the original paint supplier of the vehicle. The whole process has been a lifelong endeavor but Mike is glad that it found a home at WAAAM.</p>

          <p>WAAAM is the 4th owner of this vehicle. It started off as a farming rig and was later traded to another farmer in Oregon City who used it often. He gifted it to his daughter in the early 1970s when she got her drivers license because of its rugged reliability. She faithfully drove it everywhere before mechanical wear began to cause too many problems and her own family became too big to fit in the Jeep. In the late 2000s the Jeep started substantial restoration and after a decade of work, it was back in fighting form once again. Moravec donated "Meep" the Jeep so that all could see and enjoy this fairly rare Willys model.</p>

          <p>Our Golden Hawk was donated by Lois Bowman. Studebaker Golden Hawks are her all-time favorite car and have been ever since her parents got one in 1957. Even after the family car sold she continued to have fond memories of the car but they were expensive for the time and rather difficult to find. In 1957 they were the fastest car that you could get out of a factory. With no modifications you could get up to 140 mph out of the dealer’s showroom door. The original owner of this 1957 Golden Hawk bought it in California despite living up in Canada at the time. When he died he willed it to his nephew who was not interested in it and quickly sold it to another man, Frank, who lived just 5 miles from Lois’ house at Nimpo Lake in British Columbia. According to the Canadian Studebaker Club there were only 4 Golden Hawks left in the country at that time. When Frank’s health began to wane he contacted, Terry – Lois’ husband – to see if he wanted to buy what they both knew was Lois’ favorite car. Terry bought it and gave it to Lois on her 65<sup>th</sup> birthday. When WAAAM opened it was only natural for the Golden Hawk to find a home in the museum where thousands could enjoy the unique vehicle. This Golden Hawk was part of the original museum displays and in April 2013 it was donated to the museum. The car is completely original just like it was off of the showroom floor.</p>

Technically, there were no major body changes done to the car but "minor" alterations include things like adjusting the body contouring to match the front fenders, double Oldsmobile replacement grills, Buick headlight bezels, Cadillac tail lights, dual exhaust, and many other fun goodies to give the car its own personal flair.

          <p>To a collector of cars it is always a tough choice to declare which one in a collection is the favorite above all the others. While donor Phil loved all of the 19 cars he donated to WAAAM the number of times he wrote "I love this car" on all the paperwork that came with the vehicle we think it is safe to say it is probably his favorite.</p>

          <p>This car spend much of its life having fun racing out in the deserts of the South West. It has gone through a few body restorations but the distinct blue coloring is factory correct and the interior is still in original condition. Be on the lookout for its matching hard top shell also on display in the museum; it's usually in the back of a truck.</p>

          <p>This car is the perfect representation of the one that got away. It was sold to Jensen by an individual who had previously sold it and then bought it back from another individual. Jensen in turn sold this car too. It again changed hands twice in a decade before Jensen saw it for sale in a magazine, recognized it, and purchased it over the phone. Several years went by and with one too many cars in the barn Jensen donated it to a cause to be raffled off. He bought a few raffle tickets on a lark (so did the original owner that Jensen got the car from) and wound up winning the car back. Because the car kept coming back to him, he kept it until donating it to WAAAM in 2018.</p>
          <p>The original color of this car was "sunfire yellow." It was repainted in the 1980s to "silver pearl" to match an update to the interior.</p>

          <p>Despite mostly cosmetic changes to the Thunderbird the '66 model still proved popular with people. The full-width taillight is not a heckblende and was fairly novel for the time. This feature soon caught on with other manufacturers. For an extra $82 you could get one with an 8-track player (about the cost of 547 McDonald's hamburgers of the era or about 83 gallons of milk).</p>

          <p>The 4-4-2 is an iconic muscle car. Early ads called it the "sweetest, neatest, completest anti-boredom bundle on rubber" and hearing it roar is quite the treat. WAAAM usually treats it to a low and slow ride for various parades in town. The numbers in the name originally stood for 4 barrel carburetor, 4 speed manual transmission, dual exhaust system but continuing engine power ups and other modifications made the 442 slogan no longer quite fit. WAAAM's 1970 is actually an automatic with seat belts.</p>

          <p>Despite being unveiled in 1969, the "Thing" first reached US markets in 1973. Its design is reminiscent of one of Volkswagen's WWII offerings. Early US models are easy to spot because of one quirky flaw - the doors are designed to be removable for this line but when you remove the doors you also remove the side mirrors. (Driving without side mirrors is illegal in some states even as far back as the '70s.)</p>

          <p>With quite the complicated history, WAAAM's Avanti II two-door was among the last years of the cars sold direct from the factory. During this era, production usually ran between 50 and 200 cars a year. Because of the exclusivity of the production run many buyers were able to have their interiors custom made to fit their wants leading to lots of fun variations in the model.</p>

        <p>Gas shortage was the buzzword for the 1970s. Many automobile manufactures offered better economy (anything above 15 MPG) and other improvements to entice buyers but David Edmonson thought beyond the box with his “build it small and light” approach. While microcars, commuter cars, and the occasional high mileage vehicle have popped up since the dawn of the automobile, the HMV Freeway pushed its light weight and aerodynamic nature to the maximum. Early testing of the Freeway soon lead to the guarantee of having 100 MPG at a consistent 40 MPH. HMV even stands for High Mileage Vehicle.</p>
