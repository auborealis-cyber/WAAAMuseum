          <img src="https://www.waaamuseum.org/images/Collections/Airplanes/Sopwith_Scout.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="WAAAM's 1916 Sopwith Scout (AKA the Pup) wows audiences with an engine run up during the Annual Hood River Fly-In">
            <p>Year: 1916</p>
            <p>Acquired with funds from Bryan Reid, Sr with thanks to Larry Howard.</p>
            <p>Engine: Le Rhone, 80 HP</p>
            <p>The Sopwith Pup (officially “Scout”) got the “Pup” nickname from its small size compared to its predecessor, the Sopwith “1-1/2 Strutter.” It was a light, maneuverable and capable single seat fighter armed with a Vickers machine gun that was synchronized to shoot through the propeller disk. On August 2, 1916, a Pup was the first aircraft to land aboard a moving ship. By December 1917 aviation had advanced so much that the Pup was replaced, rendered obsolete for combat by more modern fighters like the Sopwith Camel and the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5. It continued in service behind the lines, for training, and Home Defense. This is WAAAM’s first aircraft powered by a rotary engine.</p>

            <p>Engine: Curtiss OX-5, 90 HP</p>
            <p>Designed by Glenn Curtiss and B. Douglas Thomas, the Curtiss JN-4D “Jenny” was the trainer of choice in both the US and England during World War I. Over 9,000 Jennys (including 2,700 JN-4D) were built by six companies and it’s estimated that 95% of American and British WWI pilots received training in the Jenny. One version of the Jenny was used by General Pershing in 1916 to pursue Pancho Villa after he’d attacked the U.S. 13th Cavalry at Camp Furlong, New Mexico. When WWI ended the Curtiss Airplane Company bought back large numbers of Jennys, refurbished them and resold them in the civilian market. Many pilots used their Army training to introduce America to flight by “barnstorming” or flying from town to town to show off with acrobatics and wingwalking and to sell rides. The first scheduled air mail flights in the USA in 1918 used Jennys.</p>

            <p>Engine: Lycoming R-680, 215 HP</p>
            <p>This one-and-only airplane is the prototype of the Stearman Model 75 “Kaydet” biplane, an icon of aviation. The Model 70 was a blend of the Boeing 203 and the Stearman Model 6 Cloudboy and took just 60 days from idea to first flight. The Model 70 design was so refined that the Army considered its stall too gentle for a military trainer so the upper wing was modified for the desired performance and the change applied to all production Kaydets. Over 10,000 Kaydets (Navy N2S, Army PT-13, -17, -18, RCAF PT-27) were built.</p>

            <p>Acquired with funds from Don Mayo.</p>
            <p>The Franklin PS-2 glider first flew in 1931. It was designed by R.E. Franklin, a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at University of Michigan who built it as an improvement over the German designs then in use. The wing is braced with struts rather than with multiple wires as was then common practice. Assembly and disassembly is much easier with struts than with wires. In 1933 Stan Smith won the National Soaring Championship in a Franklin PS-2. In 1934 three PS-2s were used in a trial of the Lustig Skytrain, a multi-glider towing arrangement intended for delivery of goods and mail. Departing New York, the three gliders were towed in a line then released in sequence over their respective destinations of Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Also in 1934, the U.S. Navy procured six PS-2s for training though these saw little use. WAAAM's PS-2 is sporting the Navy PS-2 colors. In 1938 one of the Navy PS-2s was transferred to NACA (forerunner of NASA) where it was used for ground effect research by towing a PS-2 behind a specially designed automobile. The WAAAM PS-2 was owned and flown by the University of Michigan Glider Club until 1943.</p>

            <p>The last operational biplane in the U.S. armed forces, the N3N was also the last mass-produced aircraft from the Naval Aircraft Factory. As a yellow-painted primary trainer it was nicknamed the “Yellow Peril” by trainees. Engine starting was by use of a hand crank that spun up a flywheel. When the flywheel was up to the proper speed a handle was pulled to engage the flywheel with the engine. The N3N-3 was flown with either wheels or floats. Four were transferred to the U.S. Coast Guard in 1941 and after WWII the Naval Academy kept several N3N’s on floats. The last one was struck from the inventory in 1960.</p>

            <p>As a builder of successful pre-World War II sport gliders, Laister-Kauffman was in a strong position to meet the Army’s requirements for a training glider. The initial order for 75 TG-4As was so well received a second order for 75 was placed. The TG-4A, at $4,062 apiece, was on the high end of the procurement cost range for gliders but the price included a transport trailer. Unfortunately, what was good for the civilian market – most notably, light handling and a good glide ratio – did not correspond well to the type of experience glider pilots needed for flying cumbersome combat gliders. WAAAM’s TG-4A was donated to the museum in late 2017 and was restored and flown in Spring 2018.</p>

            <p>Piper was the last of the three civilian “cub type” companies contracted to build their version of a training glider. Piper’s design was a favorite because so much of the glider was kept similar to their L-birds. By utilizing cost-cutting elements such as using rudder pedal springs for the spoiler return springs and other techniques, the cost of the TG-8 came in well under the other TGs at $2108 per glider. WAAAM’s TG-8 left service in late 1944 and was acquired by WAAAM as a project in 2012 through the generosity of the museum’s donors. The restoration began under Director of Aircraft Restorations Tom Murphy and finished by his successor Jakonah “Jay” Matson Bell and our crew of volunteers. WAAAM took it to EAA's Airventure in Oshkosh, WI in 2018 where it flew in the Warbird Review during the Friday and Saturday airshows.</p>

            <p>At the start of WWII most primary flight training in the Army Air Corps used biplanes. Given that the performance of combat aircraft was increasing, the Army evaluated trainers that would prepare pilot trainees for high performance fighters. The Fairchild M-62 with a Ranger 6-440 engine met this need and the Army ordered 270 designating them PT-19. It was superior to the biplane trainers in having flight characteristics (speed and wing loading) that resembled the combat aircraft the trainees would soon be flying. The Army then ordered 3,703 with increased power as PT-19A and then an additional 917 with added instruments and a hood over the front cockpit for instrument flight training as PT-19B.</p>

            <p>First procured by the Army as the XO-63 Cadet, this was the last airplane to be assigned an “O” (for observation) designation. This airplane is based on the civilian Interstate Cadet. The WAAAM L-6 uses a geared Franklin engine. The large, outward-canted windows made it an excellent observation platform but engine overheating was a problem that was never fully solved. The military procured fewer L-6 than any of the other L-birds, probably because of the aforementioned overheating as well as its high cost. One Interstate L-6 cost nearly as much as three Piper L-4. In 1972 a 75 HP S-1A Cadet (civilian designation) flew to 30,800 feet to set a world altitude record for light aircraft.</p>

            <p>In 1942 the Navy ordered 100 HE-1 airplanes for air ambulance service. These were based on Piper’s J5-C Cruiser, a descendant of the J3 Cub. In 1943 the HE designation was changed to AE when the Army reassigned H to helicopters. The opening turtledeck (for the Stokes stretcher) and bright yellow color are distinctive and several of these airplanes have been restored for flight.</p>

            <p>The "Kaydet" was the first military trainer airplane to be completely standardized for both Army (as PT-17) and Navy (as N2S-3). By late 1940 Boeing’s Stearman division production line was completing an airplane every three hours. Stearmans were the first airplanes trainees would fly and some 60,000 pilots took training in them. As a trainer it was built tough to take the punishment doled out by primary students and the airplane’s ground handling demanded their full attention. For 20 years after WWII ended the Stearman was the airplane of choice for “crop dusting” conversion. Most Stearmans today are flown for sport and for exhibition.</p>

            <p>Taylorcraft had been building airplanes with side-by-side seats but the market demanded tandem seating, especially for military and Civilian Pilot Training Program use. Production began in July 1941 and buyers were soon practically snatching them off the production line. The L-2 was built with Continental, Lycoming and Franklin engines and sported a distinctive “greenhouse” cabin. The L-2M had a fully cowled engine and spoilers. This airframe was modified into the TG-6 training glider with about 250 built.</p>

                    <p>For the longest time museum founder, Terry Brandt, wanted a World War I vehicle to go with WAAAM’s crown jewel, a 1917 Curtiss Jenny. For years he, along with other volunteers, collected the parts that would become this vehicle. WAAAM Volunteer Gene Wright built the chassis and made plans for the body. WAAAM Volunteer Andy Anderson put the collection of pieces together. No plans could be found so the restoration crew worked from pictures to ensure that they made an accurate vehicle. This process was very similar to what would have been done during World War I. Ford would supply contractors with the chassis and the rest of the vehicle would be done with the specific shop’s own vision of perfection. The project was finished and unveiled in May 2013 during our Second Saturday event. The restoration was funded entirely from our visitors’ generosity and the donations of parts from many individuals.</p>
