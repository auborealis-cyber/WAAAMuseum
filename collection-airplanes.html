    <h3>Museum Collection</h2>
    <p>Visitors at WAAAM quickly realize that our vehicles are not just a collection of old, unusable stuff. Once restored by our amazingly gifted volunteers, all of our antique cars and planes can and do run. More than that, they purrrrrr!</p>
    <h2>Airplane Collection</h2>
  <img src="img/waaam-new-standard-in-air-08-14.jpg" alt="New New-Standard-D25 flying in the air" class="img-fluid"><p>All of our antique airplanes have been meticulously restored from the inside out. And, unlike the aircraft at most air museums, our aircraft still fly! Be clear on this ... it's not that they "can" fly, they DO fly.  We take our aircraft out as often as we can, and we give them the workout that they want and deserve.</p><p>Most of our aircraft were flown for the purposes of personal recreation, some were used as work horses, and others were flown for military reasons.</p><p>Enjoy our list of selected airplanes of the permanent collection below.</p>

        <h3>Wright Glider Replica</h3>
        <img src="https://www.waaamuseum.org/images/Collections/Airplanes/Wright_Glider_1902_Replica.JPG" class="img-responsive wright-glider" alt="1902-Wright-Glider">
          <p>Year: 1902*</p>
          <p>Acquired with Donated Funds</p>
          <p>Wilbur and Orville Wright were determined and meticulous experimenters and after their wind tunnel experiments of 1901 showed that the Lilienthal data on wing design was wrong they applied what they had learned to the following season’s glider experiments. On this, their third glider design, they changed the shape of the wing cross section and built the first aircraft to use three-axis (pitch, yaw and roll) control. They flew in a prone position, controlled wing warp by sliding side to side in a hip cradle and controlled the elevator by rolling a horizontal bar with their hands. The rudders were coupled to the wing warping mechanism for coordinated flight, the first time that the rudders were not fixed in one position. They made nearly 1,000 flights in September and October 1902 and as many again in September and October 1903. The Wrights abandoned their glider at Kitty Hawk in 1903 and the only remaining part of it is a single wingtip in the Smithsonian Institution collection.</p>
          <p>*Parts for this replica were built by Jud L. Ketola over a number of years and it was completed for display by WAAAM volunteers in 2018.</p>

        <img src="https://www.waaamuseum.org/images/Collections/Airplanes/Curtiss-Parker_Pusher.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Curtiss Pusher">
        <p>Year: 1910*</p>
        <p>Donated by Terry Brandt</p>
        <p>This project has been restored thanks to a generous grant from the <a href="http://www.ludwick.org/" target="_blank">Ludwick Family Foundation</a>, the donation of dope and fabric from <a href="http://www.conaircraft.com/" target="_blank">Consolidated Aircraft Coatings</a>, and donations from museum visitors.</p>
        <p>(* Please note that parts of this airplane date back to 1910 according to Mr. Parker's family. Upon restoration other parts of the airplane could be identified as 1912, 1914, and other areas date to the 1920s. It did not get any sort of official paperwork by what became the FAA until 1934. More confusion about the date of this airplane also is a direct result from the painted letters on the tail - the top coat had 1910 as the date but upon removal another set of paint identified the plane as 1912. There is a possibility that both dates are the result of Hollywood-style tampering for old movies.)</p></div>

On August 2, 1916, a Pup was the first aircraft to land aboard a moving ship. By December 1917 aviation had advanced so much that the Pup was replaced, rendered obsolete for combat by more modern fighters like the Sopwith Camel and the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5. It continued in service behind the lines, for training, and Home Defense. This is WAAAM’s first aircraft powered by a rotary engine.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 85 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 112 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 787 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 1225 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 26'6"</p><p>Length: 19'4"</p><p>Height: 9'5"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 17,500'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 750' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 1770</p>

        <h3>1917 Curtiss JN-4D</h3>
		<img src="https://www.waaamuseum.org/images/Collections/Airplanes/Curtiss_JN-4D.JPG" class="img-responsive" alt="WAAAM's Curtiss Jenny flying during our 10-year Anniversary Fly-In. "><p>Year: 1917</p><p>Donation: Terry Brandt</p><p>Engine: Curtiss OX-5, 90 HP</p><p>Designed by Glenn Curtiss and B. Douglas Thomas, the Curtiss JN-4D “Jenny” was the trainer of choice in both the US and England during World War I. Over 9,000 Jennys (including 2,700 JN-4D) were built by six companies and it’s estimated that 95% of American and British WWI pilots received training in the Jenny. One version of the Jenny was used by General Pershing in 1916 to pursue Pancho Villa after he’d attacked the U.S. 13th Cavalry at Camp Furlong, New Mexico. When WWI ended the Curtiss Airplane Company bought back large numbers of Jennys, refurbished them and resold them in the civilian market. Many pilots used their Army training to introduce America to flight by “barnstorming” or flying from town to town to show off with acrobatics and wingwalking and to sell rides. The first scheduled air mail flights in the USA in 1918 used Jennys.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 60 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 75 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 1430 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 1920 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 43'7.75"</p><p>Length: 27'4"</p><p>Height: 9'10.5"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 6,500'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 200' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 2,700+</p>

Its history is complex but well documented. It was built as a Model C-2 with a war surplus, water-cooled Hispano-Suiza engine. From 1960 to 1975 it was the only Stearman airplane flying with a water-cooled engine. Following a later conversion, it flew for many years as a C-3B with a 220 HP Continental R-670 radial engine. That was its configuration when it came to WAAAM and the WAAAM crew has now restored it to its original C-2 form.</p>

"><p>Donation: Dick Pingrey</p><p>Engine: Curtiss OX-5, 90 HP</p><p>In 1919 E.M. “Matty” Laird had designed an airplane he called Swallow that, like many airplanes of the time, was little more than a “cleaned up” Jenny. After three years he sold his share of the E.M. Laird Airplane Company to his partners and returned to his hometown of Chicago. Jake Moellendick and Lloyd Stearman then teamed with Walter Beech to design a new Swallow which went to market in 1924. It was an immediate success, selling 26 airplanes in the first six months. The Swallow Company’s greatest problem was that management was always in flux. By 1927 Beech and Stearman had departed and Waverly Stearman, Lloyd’s younger brother, came in to redesign the Swallow for 1927-1928 giving it the steel tube structure that Moellendick had earlier prevented Lloyd from building. Production of the Swallow ended in 1929 after a five year run.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 85 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 100 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 1447 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 2200 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 32'8" / 32'8"</p><p>Length: 23'10"</p><p>Height: 8'11"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 12,000'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 500' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 100+</p><p>(Data pulled from Joseph Juptner's <em>U.S. Civil Aircraft</em> series.)</p>

Mooney's first airplane design was the Alexander Eaglerock which first flew on January 7, 1926. Mooney's design used the same wing panel size for all four panels so the lower wing span is greater than the upper by the two-foot width of the fuselage. It was dubbed the “Long Wing.” The extra wing area was valuable when operating airplanes with low power engines like the Curtiss OX-5 at high elevation airfields. It was a success from the start. It's not widely known that Charles Lindbergh had met with J. Don Alexander in December 1926 about the prospect of modifying a Long Wing for his solo attempt to cross the Atlantic by air but Alexander declined his request due to an already heavy workload.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 80 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 92 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 1470 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 2230 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 36' / 38'</p><p>Length: 24'11"</p><p>Height: 9'11"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 11,500'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 485' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 88+</p><p>(Data pulled from Joseph Juptner's <em>U.S. Civil Aircraft</em> series.)</p>

Originally designed in 1925 with a Liberty engine to carry only mail, it was redesigned in 1927 with a different engine and adding seats for two passengers. Beginning in July 1927 the Boeing 40 flew the Chicago-San Francisco air mail route. Cabin accommodation later increased to four passengers. This airplane was totaled in a crash in Southern Oregon in 1928 and its restoration was completed in 2008 after eight years and 18,000 man-hours. In May 2010 Addison Pemberton flew it “together” with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. With the Model 40 and the photographer’s airplane flying at 90 knots, Dreamliner serial number 001 made three passes at 190 knots, giving the photographer about 3-7 seconds to get his shots. This Boeing 40 has gone to many events all across the US and reenacted flights along several legs of the original Contract Airmail Routes.

The Monocoupe is a Don A. Luscombe design with an enclosed cabin so one could dress for business while flying. The name “Monocoupe” stems from the marriage of monoplane (single wing) and coupe (a 2-passenger enclosed car). Monocoupe owners were almost obnoxious in their enthusiasm for it. During 1928 nearly 90% of all light airplanes built and sold in the U.S. were Monocoupes. Much of its success accrued to the Velie M-5 engine. Visibility from the cabin was excellent due to oversized windows and a skylight. Phoebe Omlie, the first woman to hold a Transport Pilot license, served ably as a goodwill ambassador for the Monocoupe airplane, flying hers in the National Air Tour and in the Women’s Air Derby of 1929. After the demise of the Velie Motor Company Monocoupe was sold.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 85 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 98 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 795 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 1350 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 32' </p><p>Length: 19'9"</p><p>Height: 6'3"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 10,500'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 500' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 370</p><p>(Data pulled from Joseph Juptner's <em>U.S. Civil Aircraft</em> series.)</p>

Cessna’s first production model was the Model A, which was fitted with various engines over its production life. The airframe is conventional tube and fabric construction and the wing is a full cantilever design, i.e. it has no supporting struts. This design was the cause of a long delay in certification because government regulators had to be convinced that a strutless design could be strong enough for safety. There’s a famous photo of the prototype Cessna Model A with seventeen men standing on the wing. Between 1928 and 1930 Cessna built 48-50 of the four-seat Model AW, fitted with a 110 HP Warner Scarab radial engine. In 1928 Cessna test pilot Earl Rowland, flying the aerodynamically clean Model AW, won the Class A Transcontinental Air Derby.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 105 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 125 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 1225 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 2260 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 40'</p><p>Length: 24'9"</p><p>Height: 6'11"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 12,000'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 620' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 48</p><p>(Data pulled from Joseph Juptner's <em>U.S. Civil Aircraft</em> series.)</p>

It was also built with other engines including the 6-cylinder Curtiss Challenger radial and the 5-cylinder Wright J-6-5 radial. Many noteworthy flights were made with versions of the Robin including Red Jackson’s 400 consecutive rolls in 1929, the Key Brothers’ record endurance flight of more than 27 days in June 1935 and Douglas “Wrong Way” Corrigan’s Atlantic Ocean crossing in 1938.

It exhibited good air and ground maneuverability.

It originally came with a 90 HP Cirrus inline engine. Warner radial, Menasco and Ranger engines soon replaced the Cirrus. The cockpit is roomy compared to its competitors. The Great Lakes is fun to fly and its landing characteristics are excellent. With Tex Rankin at the controls a Great Lakes holds the current world record for consecutive outside loops: 131! It was a very successful airplane with approximately 450 built from 1929 to 1936 when the Great Lakes Aircraft Company closed up shop due to the Great Depression. In the 1960’s the design was resurrected as a plans-built airplane. The rights were sold to Douglas Champlin who manufactured it from 1973 to 1984. In 2011 the Waco Classic Company announced resumption of Great Lakes production with two models, Touring and Sport.</p>

"><p>Acquired by funds from Terry Brandt with special thanks to Alan Lopez.</p><p>Engine: Pratt Whitney R-1690 Hornet, 525 HP</p><p>Our “Bull Stearman” was so-nicknamed for its imposing physical size and extreme loudness compared to contemporary airplanes. It is the largest airplane built by Stearman. This was one of the six M-2’s bought by Varney Airlines for use on the Portland-Seattle-Spokane Contract Air Mail Route 32. One M-2 was built for a private owner and used a Pratt &amp; Whitney Hornet engine. Its 46-foot wingspan is the longest in the WAAAM collection, exceeding even the Boeing Model 40C. The M-2 was built to carry a pilot plus 1,000 lbs. of mail. Stearman’s selection of the troublesome Wright R-1750 Cyclone engine contributed to the airplane’s downfall. Varney lost three of its six M-2’s in their first year. Future Varney orders went to Boeing for their Model 40 and no other operators ordered M-2 Speedmails. United Airlines (of which Varney was a component) sold NC9055 in 1932. This airplane was enroute to Alaska in October 1939 when it landed at the shore of Teslin Lake, Yukon Territory and turned upside down. It lay in the water until it was retrieved in 1989. Restorer Alan Lopez wrote a book (available in the museum gift shop) about the history and restoration of this airplane.</p>

Alfaro designed and flew airplanes throughout his life, many of them while he lived in the U.S. His best known airplane is a modification, for the 1927 Dole Trophy Race, of the Air King biplane “City of Peoria”. Alfaro was an instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for a time and around 1938 developed an axial engine that was produced by the Hendee Manufacturing Company, maker of Indian motorcycles. Little information is available on the Alfaro PTG-2 Primary Glider except that at least five are known to have been registered in the U.S. around 1930. It is likely that the WAAAM PTG-2 is the only one remaining.</p>

Laird Commercial airplanes were hand built and advertised as “Thoroughbreds of the Air.” The airframe construction is extraordinarily unusual in that it is a combination of steel “clusters” with aluminum tubing. The high price of hand work kept Laird’s production numbers low and today flying examples are particularly rare. Just four of the LC-1B-300 were built and only this one remains. The paint scheme is what it had as an official airplane of the 1931 Ford National Air Tour. In its life it has served in many capacities: it was the sixth company airplane of the Berry Brothers aircraft paint company, it towed banners, it was a skywriter, it worked as a crop duster and an agricultural spray plane, it flew coastal patrol and towed targets during WWII. It sat derelict in Southern California for over 25 years before being a restoration project for nearly 25 more. It was completed in 2008 and enjoyed traveling to many events including WAAAM's own Annual Hood River Fly-In several times before being donated in 2017.</p>

It has two seats and four (!) throttle controls. At that time it was undecided whether pilots should hold the stick in the right hand and operate throttle with the left or vice versa so Lincoln gave them freedom of choice. An option that Lincoln offered was the Bloxham “Safe-T-Stick” that would allow an instructor to disengage the student’s control stick if the student panicked or froze on the controls.

It performed acrobatics slowly and gracefully, ably carried wing walkers and its front cockpit accommodated four passengers for joyrides. From a pilot’s perspective, the aileron control was quite stiff but the rudder kept things in proper order.

The cheapest way to participate was with a primary glider which saw great popularity in the late 1920’s in Europe. After WWI Germany was not permitted to build and fly powered aircraft so they took a particular interest in gliders. Primary gliders are minimal aircraft, little more than a seat on a wood or steel tube truss with a wing and tail feathers attached. They were most often launched from a hilltop by several men pulling on shock cords (bungees). WACO and Cessna were among the U.S. builders of these birds. Primary gliders were successful as trainers in Europe but were less successful in the U.S. where Europe’s discipline in primary glider training was absent. The U.S. accident rate far exceeded that of Europe and the Air Bureau stepped in to stanch the bloodshed. The WAAAM WACO Primary Glider, a WACO-built original, was restored by museum volunteers in 2014.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Glide Ration: 15:1</p><p>Empty Weight: 225 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 450 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 36'</p><p>Length: 21'</p><p>Height: 10'</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 300-ish</p>

The C-3 has a 36 HP (later 40 HP) two-cylinder engine. A factory demonstrator was flown on a 13,000 mile, 17-state tour showing off its practicality. Often described as a powered glider, the C-3 was a hit with flying schools and private owners due to its low cost of operation. It is a gentle flyer and early owners often flew solo with as little as five hours of instruction. The shape of the fuselage of the C-2 and C-3 invoked its nickname The Flying Bathtub and the triangle-shaped upper fuselage suggested “razor-back.” Production ran from 1931 to 1937.</p>

The wing is braced with struts rather than with multiple wires as was then common practice. Assembly and disassembly is much easier with struts than with wires. In 1933 Stan Smith won the National Soaring Championship in a Franklin PS-2. In 1934 three PS-2s were used in a trial of the Lustig Skytrain, a multi-glider towing arrangement intended for delivery of goods and mail. Departing New York, the three gliders were towed in a line then released in sequence over their respective destinations of Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Also in 1934, the U.S. Navy procured six PS-2s for training though these saw little use. WAAAM's PS-2 is sporting the Navy PS-2 colors. In 1938 one of the Navy PS-2s was transferred to NACA (forerunner of NASA) where it was used for ground effect research by towing a PS-2 behind a specially designed automobile.

She specified all the equipment and the color scheme, including the gold trim that incorporated her initials as design elements. She also specified that no company logo appear on the exterior. Miss Johnston sold the airplane following an engine fire. It was repaired and during WWII it served as a secondary phase trainer in the Civilian Pilot Training Program. The canopy was blacked out for instrument training with the instructor flying in the front cockpit.</p><p>Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 135 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 150 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 1675 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 2650 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 30' / 29'10"</p><p>Length: 23'4"</p><p>Height: 8'5"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 17,500'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 1100' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 2</p><p>(Data pulled from Joseph Juptner's <em>U.S. Civil Aircraft</em> series.)</p>

" width="250" height="187"><p>Photo credit: Lyle Jansma</p><p>Acquired with funds from Jerry Wenger</p><p>Fred Slingsby was an RAF pilot who repaired gliders and designed his own which were based on German designs. He founded Slingsby Sailplanes, Ltd., moved it to the village of Kirbymoorside, England and in 1935 made improvements to the very successful German Grunau Baby II, which he was building under license. He extended the wing span slightly, used Grunau Baby parts wherever he could and streamlined the fuselage, dubbing his glider the T.6 Kirby Kite. It was a high performance aircraft for its time, making a 55-mile flight in its first competition. In WWII sixteen Kirby Kites were impressed into service for RAF pilot training. Of the many Kirby Kites built only about eight remain. The one in WAAAM’s collection was restored by Bob Gaines with the original varnish finish it had from the factory in 1939. In 2002 this airplane won the Vintage Sailplane Association Restoration Award.</p>

" width="250" height="166"><p>Acquired with funds from Jerry Wenger.</p><p>Based in part on the successful German Rhönadler, the Slingsby Petrel quickly became a darling of the skies. After just three units production halted due to World War II. During the war this Petrel was impressed for training both anti-aircraft gun crews and the Royal Observer Corps’ aerial spotters. Post-war, as British Glider Association (BGA) 418, WAAAM’s Petrel continued to draw the eyes of many including the glider enthusiast Bob Gaines of the USA who purchased this glider in 2001 and was flying it stateside by 2002. Gaines began a complete restoration in 2005 but he passed away before it was finished. Through the generosity of WAAAM’s donors, the museum was able to acquire four gliders from the Gaines collection. The Petrel restoration was completed to original factory style and once again took to the air in June 2017.</p>

After the company’s owners parted ways in December 1937 the factory was moved to Lock Haven, PA and reorganized as the Piper Aircraft Company. When first produced, the J-3 was powered by the same Continental A-40 engine used on the E-2 and J-2 but the requirement for dual ignition engines was enacted around that time and the Cub was fitted with other engines, finally settling on the Continental 65 HP engine, an important part of the Cub legend. Today's popularity of the Cub is not simply nostalgia, it is "stick and rudder flying" in its most elementary form.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 65 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 76 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 680 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 1220 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 35'3"</p><p>Length: 22'5"</p><p>Height: 6'8"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 11,500'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 450' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 19,888</p><p>(Data pulled from Joseph Juptner's <em>U.S. Civil Aircraft</em> series.)</p>

While the floats are large, they are very light. Floats generally cause considerable drag and slow the airspeed of an airplane but the Cub on floats actually flies 2 MPH faster than a Cub on wheels due to the geometry of the installation. The Cub floats generate their own lift, taking some load off the wings.</p>

That it was popular is beyond doubt; Joseph Juptner remarked that "it sold like penny candy near a schoolyard." It was so popular on the West Coast that it was shipped there by the boxcar load. One pilot remarked on its ease of getting in and out writing, “It doesn’t require a short course in yoga.” The onset of WWII ended production of the Cub Coupe after building some 1,250 of all versions.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 96 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 100 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 865 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 1400 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 36'2"</p><p>Length: 22'6"</p><p>Height: 6'10"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 12,000'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 450' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 90</p><p>(Data pulled from Joseph Juptner's <em>U.S. Civil Aircraft</em> series.)</p>

The fuselage pod is a wooden monocoque design and the balance of the structure is wood with fabric covering. The wing design was based on that of the German Grunau Baby 2. Parts for 90 aircraft were made but according to the National Air and Space Museum probably only 50-60 were completed and flown. Distance flights of 263 and 280 miles were flown in the Baby Albatross as well as a flight to 10,000 feet of altitude. Bowlus’ company was backed by many aviation luminaries such as Reuben H.

It was superior to the biplane trainers in having flight characteristics (speed and wing loading) that resembled the combat aircraft the trainees would soon be flying.

<p>The "Kaydet" was the first military trainer airplane to be completely standardized for both Army (as PT-17) and Navy (as N2S-3). By late 1940 Boeing’s Stearman division production line was completing an airplane every three hours. Stearmans were the first airplanes trainees would fly and some 60,000 pilots took training in them. As a trainer it was built tough to take the punishment doled out by primary students and the airplane’s ground handling demanded their full attention. For 20 years after WWII ended the Stearman was the airplane of choice for “crop dusting” conversion. Most Stearmans today are flown for sport and for exhibition.</p>

<p>In essence, a widened PA-12 Super Cruiser with the addition of flaps, Piper's PA-14 Family Cruiser was the company’s response to the demand for four-seat airplanes. The accommodations were, to be charitable, “cozy.” Unfortunately, the airplane was introduced shortly before Piper’s financial straits drove it into receivership and only 238 were built. Today many of the those still flying are Alaska where they have been much-modified and are considered desirable workhorses of backcountry flying. Reflecting its backcountry role, the WAAAM PA-14 is on floats. This aircraft was refurbished in our restoration shop during Winter 2018 and went on display in March 2019.</p>

<p>The Vagabond was Piper’s first post-war design. Its structure was similar to the Cub and it was built on much of the same production tooling. The fuselage changed from the tandem seating of the Cub to side-by-side seating. The cost savings realized by using existing material and design probably saved Piper from bankruptcy at that time.

In 1958 legendary Alaska bush pilot Don Sheldon made a famous canyon rescue by floating his Sedan backward through a rapids several times to effect a rescue.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 105 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 120 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 1150 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 2050 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 37'6"</p><p>Length: 25'3"</p><p>Height: 7'</p><p>Service Ceiling: 12,400'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 650' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 400-500+</p><p>(Data pulled from Joseph Juptner's <em>U.S. Civil Aircraft</em> series.)</p>

The Condor IV was the fourth in the successful Condor series of gliders designed by Dittmar and was his first two-seater. Our Condor IV glider, one of four built by Dittmar himself, was completed in 1951. The following year this aircraft set a world speed record for the 100 km triangle course.

<p>Piper's final offering in the Cub line was one of its most successful with ten thousand Super Cubs built from 1949 to 1994. Even today the Super Cub is a highly desirable airplane, selling on the used market for a significant premium over other comparable airplanes. It was intended from the outset to be a working airplane, serving as a trainer, power line and pipeline patrol, banner and glider towing, military liaison and bush flying. It’s the airplane of choice for many bush pilots in Alaska.</p>

In 1954 Callair introduced the first purpose-built agricultural airplane of which the A-6 is an improved version. The most eye catching feature of the airplane is the cockpit offset from the centerline to make room for the chemical hopper. Callairs were popular as towplanes for gliders.</p>

Piper needed a two-seat trainer so they adapted the four-seat Tri-Pacer by removing two seats, the rear door, one fuel tank, the rear windows and eliminating flaps. While not as popular as its four-seat sibling it was successful with nearly 2,000 sold. The end of production in 1963 marked the end of the short wing Pipers.</p>

<p>The Glasflügel Libelle is an all glass-fiber single-seat Open class glider. In 1964 the H-301 was the first all glass-fiber glider certified in Germany and in the U.S.A. and the company was the first to produce glass-fiber gliders in quantity. The glider has a retractable wheel and flaps that change the wing’s camber (shape), features that moved it from the 15-meter class to the Open class for competition. Other features that made it a standout include a tongue-fork wing attachment (soon adopted by other manufacturers), spring-seated airbrakes and a compartment built into the leading edge for water ballast that is used to increase wing-loading for higher speeds on cross country flights. Two different canopies were available, one with a vent for normal flight and one for racing.</p>

" width="187" height="250"><p>Donation: Tim Smith</p><p>Hot air balloons are the oldest form of human-carrying aviation. The first manned flight was in November 1783 when a balloon built by the French Montgolfier brothers made a 20-minute flight with two men aboard. A week later a flight of 27 miles was made from Paris to the town of Nesle. By 1786 ballooning had fallen out of favor due to the inability to carry enough fuel for longer flights. The development of propane burners in the 1960’s and 20th century advancements in fabric and lines restored interest in hot air balloon flight. The Skyhawk was built by the Avian Balloon Company. Its 55’ diameter, 66’ high, ripstop Nylon envelope encloses 80,000 cubic feet, about equal to the volume of a 1,000 square foot house. Its empty weight with full fuel is 600 lbs (273 Kg) and it has a gross lift rating of 1,400 lbs (636 Kg). The lightweight 39” x 48” basket is made of hand woven rattan. These balloons are still made in the USA.</p>
