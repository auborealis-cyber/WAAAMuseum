    <h3>Museum Collection</h2>
    <p>Visitors at WAAAM quickly realize that our vehicles are not just a collection of old, unusable stuff. Once restored by our amazingly gifted volunteers, all of our antique cars and planes can and do run. More than that, they purrrrrr!</p>
    <h2>Airplane Collection</h2>
  <img src="img/waaam-new-standard-in-air-08-14.jpg" alt="New New-Standard-D25 flying in the air" class="img-fluid">
    <p>All of our antique airplanes have been meticulously restored from the inside out. And, unlike the aircraft at most air museums, our aircraft still fly! Be clear on this ... it's not that they "can" fly, they DO fly.  We take our aircraft out as often as we can, and we give them the workout that they want and deserve.</p>
    <p>Most of our aircraft were flown for the purposes of personal recreation, some were used as work horses, and others were flown for military reasons.</p>
    <p>Enjoy our list of selected airplanes of the permanent collection below.</p>

        <h3>Wright Glider Replica</h3>
        <img src="https://www.waaamuseum.org/images/Collections/Airplanes/Wright_Glider_1902_Replica.JPG" class="img-responsive wright-glider" alt="1902-Wright-Glider">
          <p>Year: 1902*</p>
          <p>Acquired with Donated Funds</p>
          <p>Wilbur and Orville Wright were determined and meticulous experimenters and after their wind tunnel experiments of 1901 showed that the Lilienthal data on wing design was wrong they applied what they had learned to the following season’s glider experiments. On this, their third glider design, they changed the shape of the wing cross section and built the first aircraft to use three-axis (pitch, yaw and roll) control. They flew in a prone position, controlled wing warp by sliding side to side in a hip cradle and controlled the elevator by rolling a horizontal bar with their hands. The rudders were coupled to the wing warping mechanism for coordinated flight, the first time that the rudders were not fixed in one position. They made nearly 1,000 flights in September and October 1902 and as many again in September and October 1903. The Wrights abandoned their glider at Kitty Hawk in 1903 and the only remaining part of it is a single wingtip in the Smithsonian Institution collection.</p>
          <p>*Parts for this replica were built by Jud L. Ketola over a number of years and it was completed for display by WAAAM volunteers in 2018.</p>

        <h3>1910 Curtiss Pusher</h3>
        <img src="https://www.waaamuseum.org/images/Collections/Airplanes/Curtiss-Parker_Pusher.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Curtiss Pusher">
        <p>Year: 1910*</p>
        <p>Donated by Terry Brandt</p>
        <p>This project has been restored thanks to a generous grant from the <a href="http://www.ludwick.org/" target="_blank">Ludwick Family Foundation</a>, the donation of dope and fabric from <a href="http://www.conaircraft.com/" target="_blank">Consolidated Aircraft Coatings</a>, and donations from museum visitors.</p>
        <p>(* Please note that parts of this airplane date back to 1910 according to Mr. Parker's family. Upon restoration other parts of the airplane could be identified as 1912, 1914, and other areas date to the 1920s. It did not get any sort of official paperwork by what became the FAA until 1934. More confusion about the date of this airplane also is a direct result from the painted letters on the tail - the top coat had 1910 as the date but upon removal another set of paint identified the plane as 1912. There is a possibility that both dates are the result of Hollywood-style tampering for old movies.)</p></div>

On August 2, 1916, a Pup was the first aircraft to land aboard a moving ship. By December 1917 aviation had advanced so much that the Pup was replaced, rendered obsolete for combat by more modern fighters like the Sopwith Camel and the Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5. It continued in service behind the lines, for training, and Home Defense. This is WAAAM’s first aircraft powered by a rotary engine.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 85 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 112 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 787 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 1225 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 26'6"</p><p>Length: 19'4"</p><p>Height: 9'5"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 17,500'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 750' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 1770</p>

        <h3>1917 Curtiss JN-4D</h3>
		<img src="https://www.waaamuseum.org/images/Collections/Airplanes/Curtiss_JN-4D.JPG" class="img-responsive" alt="WAAAM's Curtiss Jenny flying during our 10-year Anniversary Fly-In. "><p>Year: 1917</p><p>Donation: Terry Brandt</p><p>Engine: Curtiss OX-5, 90 HP</p><p>Designed by Glenn Curtiss and B. Douglas Thomas, the Curtiss JN-4D “Jenny” was the trainer of choice in both the US and England during World War I. Over 9,000 Jennys (including 2,700 JN-4D) were built by six companies and it’s estimated that 95% of American and British WWI pilots received training in the Jenny. One version of the Jenny was used by General Pershing in 1916 to pursue Pancho Villa after he’d attacked the U.S. 13th Cavalry at Camp Furlong, New Mexico. When WWI ended the Curtiss Airplane Company bought back large numbers of Jennys, refurbished them and resold them in the civilian market. Many pilots used their Army training to introduce America to flight by “barnstorming” or flying from town to town to show off with acrobatics and wingwalking and to sell rides. The first scheduled air mail flights in the USA in 1918 used Jennys.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 60 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 75 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 1430 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 1920 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 43'7.75"</p><p>Length: 27'4"</p><p>Height: 9'10.5"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 6,500'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 200' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 2,700+</p>

Its history is complex but well documented. It was built as a Model C-2 with a war surplus, water-cooled Hispano-Suiza engine. From 1960 to 1975 it was the only Stearman airplane flying with a water-cooled engine. Following a later conversion, it flew for many years as a C-3B with a 220 HP Continental R-670 radial engine. That was its configuration when it came to WAAAM and the WAAAM crew has now restored it to its original C-2 form.</p>

After three years he sold his share of the E.M. Laird Airplane Company to his partners and returned to his hometown of Chicago. Jake Moellendick and Lloyd Stearman then teamed with Walter Beech to design a new Swallow which went to market in 1924. It was an immediate success, selling 26 airplanes in the first six months. The Swallow Company’s greatest problem was that management was always in flux. By 1927 Beech and Stearman had departed and Waverly Stearman, Lloyd’s younger brother, came in to redesign the Swallow for 1927-1928 giving it the steel tube structure that Moellendick had earlier prevented Lloyd from building. Production of the Swallow ended in 1929 after a five year run.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 85 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 100 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 1447 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 2200 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 32'8" / 32'8"</p><p>Length: 23'10"</p><p>Height: 8'11"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 12,000'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 500' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 100+</p><p>(Data pulled from Joseph Juptner's <em>U.S. Civil Aircraft</em> series.)</p>

Mooney's first airplane design was the Alexander Eaglerock which first flew on January 7, 1926. Mooney's design used the same wing panel size for all four panels so the lower wing span is greater than the upper by the two-foot width of the fuselage. It was dubbed the “Long Wing.” The extra wing area was valuable when operating airplanes with low power engines like the Curtiss OX-5 at high elevation airfields. It was a success from the start. It's not widely known that Charles Lindbergh had met with J. Don Alexander in December 1926 about the prospect of modifying a Long Wing for his solo attempt to cross the Atlantic by air but Alexander declined his request due to an already heavy workload.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 80 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 92 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 1470 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 2230 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 36' / 38'</p><p>Length: 24'11"</p><p>Height: 9'11"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 11,500'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 485' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 88+</p><p>(Data pulled from Joseph Juptner's <em>U.S. Civil Aircraft</em> series.)</p>

Originally designed in 1925 with a Liberty engine to carry only mail, it was redesigned in 1927 with a different engine and adding seats for two passengers. Beginning in July 1927 the Boeing 40 flew the Chicago-San Francisco air mail route. Cabin accommodation later increased to four passengers. This airplane was totaled in a crash in Southern Oregon in 1928 and its restoration was completed in 2008 after eight years and 18,000 man-hours. In May 2010 Addison Pemberton flew it “together” with the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. With the Model 40 and the photographer’s airplane flying at 90 knots, Dreamliner serial number 001 made three passes at 190 knots, giving the photographer about 3-7 seconds to get his shots. This Boeing 40 has gone to many events all across the US and reenacted flights along several legs of the original Contract Airmail Routes.

The Monocoupe is a Don A. Luscombe design with an enclosed cabin so one could dress for business while flying. The name “Monocoupe” stems from the marriage of monoplane (single wing) and coupe (a 2-passenger enclosed car). Monocoupe owners were almost obnoxious in their enthusiasm for it. During 1928 nearly 90% of all light airplanes built and sold in the U.S. were Monocoupes. Much of its success accrued to the Velie M-5 engine. Visibility from the cabin was excellent due to oversized windows and a skylight. Phoebe Omlie, the first woman to hold a Transport Pilot license, served ably as a goodwill ambassador for the Monocoupe airplane, flying hers in the National Air Tour and in the Women’s Air Derby of 1929.

Cessna’s first production model was the Model A, which was fitted with various engines over its production life. The airframe is conventional tube and fabric construction and the wing is a full cantilever design, i.e. it has no supporting struts. This design was the cause of a long delay in certification because government regulators had to be convinced that a strutless design could be strong enough for safety. There’s a famous photo of the prototype Cessna Model A with seventeen men standing on the wing. Between 1928 and 1930 Cessna built 48-50 of the four-seat Model AW, fitted with a 110 HP Warner Scarab radial engine. In 1928 Cessna test pilot Earl Rowland, flying the aerodynamically clean Model AW, won the Class A Transcontinental Air Derby.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 105 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 125 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 1225 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 2260 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 40'</p><p>Length: 24'9"</p><p>Height: 6'11"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 12,000'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 620' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 48</p><p>(Data pulled from Joseph Juptner's <em>U.S. Civil Aircraft</em> series.)</p>

Many noteworthy flights were made with versions of the Robin including Red Jackson’s 400 consecutive rolls in 1929, the Key Brothers’ record endurance flight of more than 27 days in June 1935 and Douglas “Wrong Way” Corrigan’s Atlantic Ocean crossing in 1938.

It exhibited good air and ground maneuverability.

It originally came with a 90 HP Cirrus inline engine. Warner radial, Menasco and Ranger engines soon replaced the Cirrus. The cockpit is roomy compared to its competitors. The Great Lakes is fun to fly and its landing characteristics are excellent. With Tex Rankin at the controls a Great Lakes holds the current world record for consecutive outside loops: 131! It was a very successful airplane with approximately 450 built from 1929 to 1936 when the Great Lakes Aircraft Company closed up shop due to the Great Depression. In the 1960’s the design was resurrected as a plans-built airplane. The rights were sold to Douglas Champlin who manufactured it from 1973 to 1984. In 2011 the Waco Classic Company announced resumption of Great Lakes production with two models, Touring and Sport.</p>

"><p>Acquired by funds from Terry Brandt with special thanks to Alan Lopez.</p><p>Engine: Pratt Whitney R-1690 Hornet, 525 HP</p><p>Our “Bull Stearman” was so-nicknamed for its imposing physical size and extreme loudness compared to contemporary airplanes. It is the largest airplane built by Stearman. This was one of the six M-2’s bought by Varney Airlines for use on the Portland-Seattle-Spokane Contract Air Mail Route 32. One M-2 was built for a private owner and used a Pratt &amp; Whitney Hornet engine. Its 46-foot wingspan is the longest in the WAAAM collection, exceeding even the Boeing Model 40C. The M-2 was built to carry a pilot plus 1,000 lbs. of mail. Stearman’s selection of the troublesome Wright R-1750 Cyclone engine contributed to the airplane’s downfall. Varney lost three of its six M-2’s in their first year. Future Varney orders went to Boeing for their Model 40 and no other operators ordered M-2 Speedmails. United Airlines (of which Varney was a component) sold NC9055 in 1932. This airplane was enroute to Alaska in October 1939 when it landed at the shore of Teslin Lake, Yukon Territory and turned upside down. It lay in the water until it was retrieved in 1989. Restorer Alan Lopez wrote a book (available in the museum gift shop) about the history and restoration of this airplane.</p>

Alfaro designed and flew airplanes throughout his life, many of them while he lived in the U.S. His best known airplane is a modification, for the 1927 Dole Trophy Race, of the Air King biplane “City of Peoria”. Alfaro was an instructor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for a time and around 1938 developed an axial engine that was produced by the Hendee Manufacturing Company, maker of Indian motorcycles. Little information is available on the Alfaro PTG-2 Primary Glider except that at least five are known to have been registered in the U.S. around 1930. It is likely that the WAAAM PTG-2 is the only one remaining.</p>

Laird Commercial airplanes were hand built and advertised as “Thoroughbreds of the Air.” The airframe construction is extraordinarily unusual in that it is a combination of steel “clusters” with aluminum tubing. The high price of hand work kept Laird’s production numbers low and today flying examples are particularly rare. Just four of the LC-1B-300 were built and only this one remains. The paint scheme is what it had as an official airplane of the 1931 Ford National Air Tour. In its life it has served in many capacities: it was the sixth company airplane of the Berry Brothers aircraft paint company, it towed banners, it was a skywriter, it worked as a crop duster and an agricultural spray plane, it flew coastal patrol and towed targets during WWII. It sat derelict in Southern California for over 25 years before being a restoration project for nearly 25 more. It was completed in 2008 and enjoyed traveling to many events including WAAAM's own Annual Hood River Fly-In several times before being donated in 2017.</p>

It has two seats and four (!) throttle controls. At that time it was undecided whether pilots should hold the stick in the right hand and operate throttle with the left or vice versa so Lincoln gave them freedom of choice. An option that Lincoln offered was the Bloxham “Safe-T-Stick” that would allow an instructor to disengage the student’s control stick if the student panicked or froze on the controls.

It performed acrobatics slowly and gracefully, ably carried wing walkers and its front cockpit accommodated four passengers for joyrides. From a pilot’s perspective, the aileron control was quite stiff but the rudder kept things in proper order.

The cheapest way to participate was with a primary glider which saw great popularity in the late 1920’s in Europe. After WWI Germany was not permitted to build and fly powered aircraft so they took a particular interest in gliders. Primary gliders are minimal aircraft, little more than a seat on a wood or steel tube truss with a wing and tail feathers attached. They were most often launched from a hilltop by several men pulling on shock cords (bungees). WACO and Cessna were among the U.S. builders of these birds. Primary gliders were successful as trainers in Europe but were less successful in the U.S. where Europe’s discipline in primary glider training was absent. The U.S. accident rate far exceeded that of Europe and the Air Bureau stepped in to stanch the bloodshed. The WAAAM WACO Primary Glider, a WACO-built original, was restored by museum volunteers in 2014.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Glide Ration: 15:1</p><p>Empty Weight: 225 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 450 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 36'</p><p>Length: 21'</p><p>Height: 10'</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 300-ish</p>

Often described as a powered glider, the C-3 was a hit with flying schools and private owners due to its low cost of operation. It is a gentle flyer and early owners often flew solo with as little as five hours of instruction. The shape of the fuselage of the C-2 and C-3 invoked its nickname The Flying Bathtub and the triangle-shaped upper fuselage suggested “razor-back.” Production ran from 1931 to 1937.</p>

"><p>Donation: Terry Brandt</p><p>Engine: Lambert R-266, 90 HP</p><p>Variously described as “buxom” or “pot-bellied,” the Franklin Sport 90 was introduced into a failing economy. Built as a sport plane it had to be flown with a firm hand at all times. Little is known about the Franklin Aircraft Company because it failed in 1932 and the company’s records were ordered destroyed in 1942. Franklin built only 16 airplanes in its short life, eight with Lambert 60 HP engines and six with 90 HP engines.</p><p>Additional Specifications:</p><p>Cruise: 95 MPH</p><p>Top Speed: 115 MPH</p><p>Empty Weight: 885 lbs</p><p>Gross Weight: 1424 lbs</p><p>Wing Span: 26' / 24'</p><p>Length: 19'6"</p><p>Height: 7'9"</p><p>Service Ceiling: 10,000'</p><p>Climb in 1 Minute: 900' at sea level</p><p>Approximate Number Built: 6</p><p>(Data pulled from Joseph Juptner's <em>U.S. Civil Aircraft</em> series.)</p>
